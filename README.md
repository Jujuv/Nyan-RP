English:
Nyan-RP is a french open-source RP mode for SA:MP.

NyanRP is made from sratch but many librarys (usualy called "includes") are used to help developers.

At this time (9 december 2012) NyanRP uses more librarys than i thought: Y_Users (including Y_Uvar and Y_Ini) + Y_Commands + Fast Dialog Processing System (FDLG) + DJSON

NyanRP means "Yet another Role-Play" (YAN-RP) but i added a "N" to that name to make a word-joke with "Nyan" ("meow" in japenesse).

Nyan-RP is translated by the internet community from French to English and sometime by its author.
